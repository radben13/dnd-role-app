# DnD Role App
### by Radben13

The objective of this app is to help keep track of DnD characters based on player profiles. It is to change character sheets to a live web document.
It will also have tools for player convenience (ie. dice, lists for monsters, items, and proficiencies/feats)

## Create Player
Players are defined by username, email, password, and their profile pic (url for now)

## Create Role
Details to be added later!
